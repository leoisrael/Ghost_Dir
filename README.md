<h2 style="color: #EBC5D5; font-size: 2em;">💻 How it works</h2>
<p style="color: white; font-size: 1.2em;">👻 Ghost_Dir operates as a "hidden" tool that can quietly navigate web page subdirectories without attracting attention from administrators. This allows for safer and less disruptive penetration testing. </p>
<p style="color: white; font-size: 1.2em;">👀 Ghost_Dir can detect hidden subdirectories that other scanning tools may not be able to find, enabling the identification of possible vulnerabilities that other tests may have missed.</p>
