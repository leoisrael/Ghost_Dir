  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>Ghost_Dir is a "hidden" tool, capable of silently moving through the subdirectories of the web page without drawing attention from administrators. This means that it is possible to perform penetration tests more safely and without interruptions.</p>
  <p>Ghost_Dir is capable of detecting hidden subdirectories that other scanning tools may not be able to find. This allows you to identify possible vulnerabilities that other tests may have missed.</p>
